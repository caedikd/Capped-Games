                                "I was born and raised in Burbank, California where I was lucky enough to receive an arts based education. My parents
                            paid for it begrudgingly but I don't think they ever expected me to get into game design. Also, my brother is deaf so my family and I are fluent in
                            American Sign Language"

                            <br>
                            "I got into game design after studying graphic design at USC. I have always been an avid gamer myself and after taking
                            a game design class at my university, it just kind of solidified it."

                            <b>Is there a reason why you've decided to focus on accessible games?</b>

                            She laughs a little and gets up to show me a picture of her brother. "This is my brother Jeremy, he was born deaf
                            but has always really loved to play virtual games. When I was younger, I really got to thinking how much of gaming
                            revolves around auditory experiences and how Jer was missing so much of it. That really inspired me to create Luna 
                            and I'm currently in the prototyping stage of another accessible game so stay tuned for that!"

                            Anna Smith's game Luna is an award winning sensory game in which users specify a sensory disability and they get to play
                             a game that engages all other senses.

                            "Yeah, I absolutely asked him to test the game multiple times but I was able to use Capped Games to find more potential
                            testers with disabilities that wanted to take part in the formation of Luna."

                            "One thing I noticed when playing typical console games was that often times when you are getting to a critical moment in a 
                            game you might hear something, or the controller might shake, or something else might happen that you would use your senses to  
                            understand as the critical moment. As someone with all 5 senses, we take these in these cues very easily. I wanted to create a game
                            or product that encouraged the use of more or different senses in gaming."

                            <br><br>
                            <b>What was your favorite part of the design process?</b>

                            She picks up a few sketches of that she holds up to me (photographed on the right). "I really enjoy the sketching process when
                            I was able to do a lot of brain dumping and really utilize my graphic design degree. Now I am super proud of the game because
                            I feel like it's design is really me."


                            <br><br>
                            <b>Is there anything people should know about creating accessible games?</b>
                            <br>
                            "I think the best thing you can do when creating accessible games is to go into it with empathy and patience. Obviously creating
                            accessible games as an abled person will probably take more steps and require you to do research. But games are meant to be for
                            everyone, and accessibility in your games widens your audience."
